In order to scale meetings even further, Kaltura offers the ability to stream a meeting into a webcast. Think of meetings as multi-way interactive video, and webcast as a more unidirectional broadcast. Refer to [this guide](https://learning.kaltura.com/media/How+To+Launch+Webcasting+Through+Kaltura+Meetings/1_7xvdelh8) for how this can be accomplished without the API.

## Prerequisites

1. [Kaltura VPaaS account](https://corp.kaltura.com/video-paas/registration?utm_campaign=Meetabout&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_source=GitHub). Once you've opened an account, send an email to [VPaaS@kaltura.com](mailto:VPaaS@kaltura.com) to activate Meetings.
2. Kaltura account configured with both KAF and KME modules enabled
