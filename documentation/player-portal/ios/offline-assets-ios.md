PlayKit supports download and playback of assets.

## Download

The PlayKit component responsible for local/offline/downloaded assets is `LocalAssetsManager`.  

### Select a source to download

A `PKMediaEntry` typically has more than one PKMediaSource, so the first step is selecting the most suitable source.
Call `LocalAssetsManager.getPreferredDownloadableMediaSource(for:)`, passing a PKMediaEntry. It will try to find a downloadable 
source.

There are two mechanisms for downloading HLS assets: Kaltura's DownloadToGo (DTG) library and Apple's `AVAssetDownloadTask`. 
In most cases, **DTG** should be used. The only case in which `AVAssetDownloadTask` must be used, is when downloading **FairPlay** on iOS 10.0-10.2. 

> NOTE: We recommend that apps restrict FairPlay downloads to iOS 10.3 and up and use DTG.

### DownloadToGo (DTG)

Kaltura's DTG library can download HLS assets, with and without FairPlay protection. Please look at [DTG's guide](/player/ios/download-to-go-ios) for detailed usage instructions - the following focuses on PlayKit+DTG integration.

<div hidden>
 {% plantuml %}
    @startuml

    participant App
    participant LocalAssetsManager as LAM
    participant ContentManager as CM

    App->LAM: mediaSource = getPreferredDownloadableMediaSource(for: entry)

    App->CM: addItem(id: entry.id, url: mediaSource.contentUrl)
    App->CM: loadItemMetadata(id: entry.id, preferredVideoBitrate: 300000)
    App->CM: startItem(id: entry.id)

    ... Downloading ...

    CM-->App: finished
    App->CM: playbackUrl = itemPlaybackUrl(id: entry.id)
    App->LAM: registerDownloadedAsset(location:playbackUrl, mediaSource: mediaSource)
    LAM-->App: done
    
    @enduml
 {% endplantuml %}
</div>

This flow works for clear and AES HLS assets on iOS 8 and up. It also works for FairPlay assets on iOS 10.3 and up.

> NOTE: If the asset is FairPlay-protected, the master playlist MUST contain a EXT-X-SESSION-KEY tag with the asset's `skd` URL. Without it, LocalAssetsManager won't be able to install a FairPlay license. Example (replace ASSET_ID below with the actual id):

    #EXT-X-SESSION-KEY:METHOD=SAMPLE-AES,URI="skd://ASSET_ID",KEYFORMAT="com.apple.streamingkeydelivery",KEYFORMATVERSIONS="1"

> In **Kaltura's backend**, this is done by enabling "Allow Fairplay Offline" in the *VOD_PACKAGER_HLS* delivery profile. See [screenshot](Offline-FairPlay-delivery-profile.png).

### AVAssetDownloadTask

AVAssetDownloadTask is a facility added to iOS in version 10.0. It can download HLS assets, with and without FairPlay protection. It can also download mp4 assets.

> NOTE: As mentioned above, the only case in which `AVAssetDownloadTask` must be used, is when downloading **FairPlay** on iOS 10.0-10.2. We recommend avoiding FairPlay downloads on those iOS versions.

<div hidden>
{% plantuml %}
    @startuml 

    participant App
    participant LocalAssetsManager as LAM
    participant ContentManager as CM

    App->LAM: mediaSource = getPreferredDownloadableMediaSource(for: entry)
    App->AVURLAsset: avAsset = init(mediaSource.contentUrl)
    App->LAM: prepareForDownload(asset: avAsset, mediaSource: mediaSource)
    note over App: Create and start an AVAssetDownloadTask (out of scope)

    @enduml
{% endplantuml %}
</div>

See PlayKit's [OfflineSample](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-ios-samples/tree/develop/OfflineSampleSwift) and Apple's [HLSCatalog](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/HLSCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html) for help with using AVAssetDownloadTask.

## Playback

Call `LocalAssetsManager.createLocalMediaEntry(for:localURL:)`, returns a PKMediaEntry ready to play. 

### DTG

Call `ContentManager.itemPlaybackUrl(id:)` to get the playback URL. This is what should be passed as the `localURL` above.

### AVAssetDownloadTask

Use the download location as you saved during the download process.
