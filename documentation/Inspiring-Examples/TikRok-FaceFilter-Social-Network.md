## Creating Your Own Video Social Network in Under 20 Minutes!

In this tutorial, you will build an MVP of a social network (aka TikRok) powered by Kaltura. Tikrok is a fully functional social network. Users can record videos using a built-in face filter, upload them, and browse other usersâ€™ videos.

## Design Choices

Many shortcuts were taken in order to give you the barebones, simplest implementation of this concept aka an MVP. I chose a web front end to give a low barrier to entry across any platform. While recording does not work on all mobile browsers, the face filters do, and a more robust implementation could make use of Kaltura's many [Client Libraries](/api-docs/Client_Libraries) 

## This is just a kernel...

Donâ€™t limit yourself to copying TikRok, the purpose of this tutorial is to ignite your creativity. There are so many directions you **could** go in, for example, there are open source emotion recognition engines. Why not make an app that detects if someone is sad or angry and notify their friends they need cheering up? Food for thought. And it doesnâ€™t have to be entertaining, think healthcare/covid-19, think education, think business, think food, fashion, music, finance, holidays, think what can I do with face detection, an augmented reality canvas or just something creative with video?

## Introducing TikRok

This sample, fully functional social network lets you use a funny face filter to make a video, upload it, browse everyone's videos, and gives users their own page.

## Getting Started

1. First, you will need a free Kaltura account: start a [free trial](https://corp.kaltura.com/video-paas/registration?utm_campaign=Tikrok&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_source=GitHub)

2. Clone the TikRok Github repo https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/example-tikrok

3. Let's take a look at .env.template:

   ```ini
   ADMIN_SECRET=   //obtain from https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/settings/integrationSettings
   PARTNER_ID=     //obtain from https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/settings/integrationSettings
   PLAYER_ID=      //obtain from https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/studio/v3
   ```

   Copy  `.env.template` to `.env` and edit the values above.  

   

   We need to get your Kaltura Partner Id and API Admin Secret so let's head over to [Integration Settings tab](https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/settings/integrationSettings)

   <img src="/assets/images/tikrok/KMC_CODES.png" alt="KMC_CODES" style="zoom:45%;" />

Head to https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/studio/v3 , create a player and get its ID. Make sure to create your player through the "TV Platform Studio" as pictured:



<img src="/assets/images/tikrok/KMC_PLAYER.png" alt="KMC_PLAYER.png" style="zoom:50%;" />



4. Install the components for node:

`npm install`

5. **Its Showtime!!** run 

   `npm start`

   and head to 

   `http://localhost:3000`

## Connecting the back end to Kaltura

Pick a screen name and hit go:

![SCREEN_NAME](/assets/images/tikrok/SCREEN_NAME.png)

The next touch point is the `router.post('/', `method of `routes/login.js`

``` javascript
var adminks = await KalturaClientFactory.getKS('', {type: kaltura.enums.SessionType.ADMIN});
var client = await KalturaClientFactory.getClient(adminks);
var user = await getOrCreateUser(client, req.body.userId);
var userKs = await KalturaClientFactory.getKS(user.id,{privileges: 'editadmintags:*'});
```

Take a look at `lib/KalturaClientFactory.js` to see how the [session](../../Getting-Started-Building-Video-Applications /Authenticating-and-Using-Kaltura-Sessions.html) is created

We first create an admin session `adminks` which is required to create a user. Then we create a user session `userKs`  and store the `userKs` to the node session so it can be used later.

`req.session.ks = userKs;`

And then we are redirected to the ***REALLY*** fun stuff: the face filter!

## The Face Filter 

We will use the open source face filter library https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizFaceFilter There is nothing stopping you from getting very creative with these filters! You could supply your own artwork....the sky is the limit!

Here is a high level overview of the video creation work flow: 

![FaceFilter](/assets/images/tikrok/FaceFilter.png)

By itself, the face filter demo displays to a canvas element. Some of the demo's use `<divs>` to display graphics on top of a canvas, those demos won't work with our approach as we can only record what is actually on the canvas

### Loading and Switching Filters

 First, let's set up the filter:

```html
<style type="text/css">
.vidsize {
    width:600px;
    height:600px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body onload="init_filter()">
    <div class="vidsize" style="margin:0 auto;position: relative;">
        <div id="loading" class="loading">
            Loading Filter 
            <br>
            <img class="loading" src="//assets/images/tikrok/loading_black.png">
        </div>
        <div id="filterRow">
            <a href="#" onclick="loadFilter('football')">ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·</a>
            <a href="#" onclick="loadFilter('angel')">ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜ˆ</a>
            <a href="#" onclick="loadFilter('deform')">ðŸ¥´</a>
            <a href="#" onclick="loadFilter('faceswap')">ðŸ˜€ðŸ”„ðŸ˜€</a>
        </div>
        <div id="filterBtn"><a href="#" onclick="filterBtnToggle()">ðŸ˜ƒ</a></div>
        <canvas width="600" height="600" id='jeeFaceFilterCanvas'></canvas>
        <div id="controls" class="vidsize"></div>
    </div>
```

So `onload` calls the `initFilter()` method from the default filter at `public/filters/deform/deform.js` which sets up the canvas element to render the face filter over webcam video. I created a naming convention the code uses to switch filters and it is:

`public/filters/filtername/filtername.js` and each filter has the same initFilter() method. When `loadFilter(filter)` is called it actually routes us to a completely different webpage:

```
function loadFilter(filter) {
	window.onbeforeunload = null;
  window.location = "/record?filter="+filter
```

And the filter is loaded through a query parameter:

`<script src='facefilter/filters/<%=filter%>/<%=filter%>.js'></script>`

Nothing is stopping you from switching filters entirely in javascript, just some refactoring would be necessary. 

In case you are wondering about the `#loading` animated png...it displays by default on page load, and then is hidden by each of the four filters by calling

```
  $("#loading").hide();
} //end init_threeScene()
```

in `deform.js`

### Setup Kaltura Express Recorder

In `views/record.ejs` we will use the [Kaltura Express Recorder](/api-docs/Ingest_and_Upload_Media/express-recorder.html), which has the option to record a canvas element and combine it with your webcam's audio. 

**Note**:The github for TikRok includes a forked "canvas" version of express recorder named `kaltura-canvas-express-recorder.js`

1. `<div id="controls"` is where the [Kaltura Express Recorder](/api-docs/Ingest_and_Upload_Media/express-recorder.html) controls will be injected. These elements must all have the same video size to render properly. Now to instantiate the express recorder:

```javascript
			 const expressRec = Kaltura.ExpressRecorder.create('controls', {
            "ks": "<%=ks%>",
            "serviceUrl": "https://www.kaltura.com", // IE http://www.kaltura.com,
            "app": "APP_NAME",
            "playerUrl": "https://cdnapi.kaltura.com", // IE http://cdnapi.kaltura.com,
            "conversionProfileId": "CONVERSION_PROFILE_ID",
            "partnerId": <%=partnerId%>,
            "uiConfId": <%=playerId%>,
            "canvasId": "jeeFaceFilterCanvas"
        });
```

We have supplied all relevant id strings from node,  and we specify the canvas to record via `canvasId` [Kaltura Express Recorder](/api-docs/Ingest_and_Upload_Media/express-recorder.html) has many more configuration options and event listeners. 

2. We will also use the express recorder's event listener interface to create a better UX:

``` javascript
 				expressRec.instance.addEventListener("recordingStarted", (e) => {
            console.log(e.type);
            //hide the filter buttons when recording has started
            $('#filterRow').hide();
            $('#filterBtn').hide();
        });
        
        expressRec.instance.addEventListener("recordingCancelled", (e) => {
          	//if use hits cancel button, then show the filters again
            $('#filterBtn').show();
            console.log(e.type);   
        });

        expressRec.instance.addEventListener("mediaUploadEnded",(e) => {
           //once upload is finished, then move on to gallery
           window.onbeforeunload = null
           window.location="/gallery";
        });                  
```



3. You should see something like this: 

<img src="/assets/images/tikrok/FUNNY.PNG" alt="FUNNY" style="zoom:50%;" />

## The Gallery :

We are taking a very MVP approach to displaying the gallery with a simplifying assumption: this app will be the only source of videos connected to your account. If you want more control over how to organize videos, check out [Playlists](/api-docs/service/playlist)

The express recorder creates a [Kaltura Media Entry](/api-docs/General_Objects/Objects/KalturaMediaEntry) for your video and associates it with your user id. Our approach will simply list all media in our account via the [Media.list](/console/service/media/action/list) API call 

### Kaltura API Console

When you look at [Media.list](/console/service/media/action/list) in the console: 

![MEDIALIST](/assets/images/tikrok/MEDIALIST.png)

On the left, we can send the request or add parameters. On the right side you can auto-generate a sample code corresponding to the request on the left from all supported languages.

And the auto-generated code is very close to that of `gallery.js` :

```javascript
function getMedia(client) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let filter = new kaltura.objects.MediaEntryFilter
        filter.orderBy = kaltura.enums.MediaEntryOrderBy.UPDATED_AT_DESC;
       
        let pager = new kaltura.objects.FilterPager();
        pager.pageSize = 500;
        kaltura.services.media
            .listAction(filter, pager)
            .execute(client)
            .then(response => {
                resolve(response);
            });
    });
}
```

### Animated thumbnails

We are using https://github.com/kaltura/VideoThumbnailAnimator in `views/gallery.ejs` to provide animated thumbnails for the gallery

```ejs
    <div id="thumbnails">
        <%- include('gallery/entries.ejs', {entries: entries}) %>
    </div>
    <script>
        var thumbAnimator = new KalturaThumbAnimator();
        thumbAnimator.setup("videothumbnail", "http://cfvod.kaltura.com", 0, true); 
    </script>
```



## User Page

### Querying for user's Kaltura Media Entries

To display a users videos, We will use [Media.list](/console/service/media/action/list) but this time we will filter by userId. You can build this query using the API Console:

```javascript
let filter = new kaltura.objects.MediaEntryFilter
filter.orderBy = kaltura.enums.MediaEntryOrderBy.UPDATED_AT_DESC;
filter.userIdEqual = userId;
let pager = new kaltura.objects.FilterPager();
pager.pageSize = 500;
kaltura.services.media.listAction(filter, pager)
    .execute(client)
    .then(response => {
        resolve(response);
    });
```

### Playing Video

in `views/user.ejs`

We will be following the steps to set up a player from /player/web/getting-started-web 

```ejs
<script type="text/javascript" 
src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/<%=partnerId %>/embedPlaykitJs/uiconf_id/<%=playerId%>">
</script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        try {
            var player = KalturaPlayer.setup({
                targetId: "playerContainer",
                provider: {
                partnerId: <%= partnerId %>,
                uiConfId: <%= playerId %>
                }
            });
        player.loadMedia({ entryId: '<%= entries[0].id %>' });
        } catch (e) {
            console.error(e.message)
        }
    </script>
```



And in `routes/user/post.ejs` we will load the player with:

`<a href="#" onclick="player.loadMedia({entryId: '<%= entry.id %>'})"><img src="<%= entry.thumbnailUrl %>"></a>`
