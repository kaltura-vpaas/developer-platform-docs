title: iCal API and Calendar Integrations 
weight: 110
---

The Scheduled Events API is also exposed as a standard [iCal format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar). This provides backend support for calendar definition, including importing and exporting using the iCal standard. Importing into the Kaltura platform is done either though bulk-upload or drop-folders. 

# iCal API ingestion

1. As an iCal file synced over a Kaltura hosted [Drop-folders](https://knowledge.kaltura.com/help/kaltura-drop-folders-service-for-content-ingestion) (FTP, SFTP or Aspera). 

2. As an iCal file synced form a third-party hosted Drop-Folders over FTP, SFTP or S3. 

3. The iCal file format may also be ingested using the [`scheduleEvent.addFromBulkUpload`](/api-docs/service/scheduleEvent/action/addFromBulkUpload) API action.

   

## Download / Sync the iCal Schedule from Kaltura 

iCal provides a standardized method for syncing calendar events from Kaltura. 
To retrieving an iCal file format, add `format/ical` to the [scheduleEvent.list](/api-docs/service/scheduleEvent/action/list) API action.

For example:

```
http://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/service/schedule_scheduleevent/action/list/format/ical/filter[objectType]/KalturaScheduleEventFilter/filter[resourceIdsLike]/RESOURCE-ID
```



## The Kaltura iCal Format  

The Kaltura iCal Format follows the standard iCal format definitions, and adds Kaltura specific parameters. The additional parameters are described in the table below:

## Notable considerations when scheduling events

> To avoid returning multiple live stream endpoints in the iCal - For Live Stream Events, the iCal format will return the RTMP/RTSP endpoints and credentials as defined in the `templateEntryId`. To avoid confusion, always set the template entry id to be the same as the Live Stream Entry resource assigned to the event.
